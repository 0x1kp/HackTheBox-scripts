# Hack The Box scripts

This repository is made to upload some custom interesting scripts in different programming languages that are useful to exploit certain vulnerabilities in Hack The Box retired machines/challenges.

Detailed write-ups are posted on my personal blog: https://7rocky.netlify.app/en/htb

For every machine/challenge, there is a `README.md` file that explains how the script is built, giving some reasons why and doing some troubleshooting if necessary.

The aim of this repository is to provide useful scripts that can be adapted to other circumstances and show how some techniques can be performed using a certain programming language.

Hope it is useful! :smile:
